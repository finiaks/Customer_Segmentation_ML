# Customer Segmentation using K-Means (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **customer segmentation** using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It groups customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score** to help businesses understand customer behavior and target them effectively.

## 📊 How It Works

1. Load customer dataset
2. Scale features for fair comparison
3. Apply K-Means clustering
4. Find optimal clusters using Elbow method
5. Visualize clusters and centroids
6. Save trained model
7. Predict cluster for new customer input

## 🎯 Customer Segments Identified

* 💎 Premium Customers (High income, high spending)
* 💰 Saver Customers (High income, low spending)
* 📉 Budget Customers (Low income, low spending)
* 🛒 Impulsive Buyers (Low income, high spending)
* ⚖️ Average Customers (Medium income, medium spending)

---

## 🧪 Example Prediction

Input:
Income = 20
Spending Score = 50

Output:
Medium Income, Medium Spending Customer

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Model works best within the dataset range
* Clustering does not guarantee exact classification
* Results are based on similarity (distance)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add more features (Age, Gender)
* Improve dataset size
* Build web app using Streamlit
* Deploy model online

---

## 💡 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to group customers and generate valuable business insights.
